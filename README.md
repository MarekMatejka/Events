# Events
Events is an Android  Application developed by Faizan Joya and Marek Matejka during the Facebook London Hackathon 2015 (21 - 22 March).

Events for Facebook 2.0.

Adds some of the extra functionality we are currently missing in Facebook's Android application regarding Events like the ability to easily sync specified events with the calendar or respond to Event invites directly from the push notification.
