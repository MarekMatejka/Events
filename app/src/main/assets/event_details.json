	  "description": "Here at Facebook, we believe that every engineer possesses amazing ideas and creativity. Hackathons are a longstanding tradition at Facebook where our engineers stay up all night to create a working product or prototype from scratch. Remember- done is better than perfect.\n\nRegistration for this event has now closed.  \n\n**Please note - all members of your team must register individually for the opportunity to attend**\n\nJoin Facebook in London as we stay up all night hacking, learning and having a some fun! Start brainstorming ideas & forming teams (of up to 4 people). We'll supply the food, fun diversions, prizes, and some expert guidance in the form of our engineers. We'll also provide reimbursement for public transportation. You bring your laptop, appetite, skills and ideas.\n\nThe winning team will get the chance to compete against teams from other Hackathons at the Hackathon Finals and be judged by our executives- held at Facebook HQ in Menlo Park, California in November!\n\n*Note: You must be an enrolled university student to attend.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: How do I get there?\nA: Don't live in London? Don't worry! We'll provide transportation reimbursement for all public transportation for those traveling from outside of London (from within the UK only).\n\nQ: What type of things should we build?\nA: The world is your oyster- think of something that annoyed you today. Harness that and build your next hack. Disrupting the current industry is highly encouraged, these are the best ideas!\n\nQ: Does our project have to relate to Facebook?\nA: Not at all. But our engineers are best equipped to answer any FB related questions.\n\nQ: Do I have to be on a team? What if I don’t have one?\nA: No, but working in teams will typically allow you to get more done in the limited amount of time you'll have. If you don't have a team on the day of, we can help you find or create one.\n\nQ: Can I have a team of more than 4 people?\nA: Only four people will be flown out to California for the Hackathon Finals. You can have more than four at your school Hackathon but you’ll only get four airplane tickets.\n\nQ: What language or platform can I use?\nA: The choice is yours! As long as you are confident that you can come up with a working prototype by the end of the hackathon, you should be fine.\n\nQ: Will food be provided?\nA: It wouldn’t be a Facebook hackathon without food, and lots of it! We’ll also have plenty of caffeine drinks to keep the energy high all night long.\n\nQ: What should I bring?\nA: You should bring yourself, great ideas and a laptop. Pillows, blankets, and a toothbrush are recommended but optional.\n\nQ: Who owns the code after we're done?\nA: You do! Facebook does not own any of your code. Feel free to open source your code, expand on it, etc. This is a great opportunity to make use of advice from industry experts!\n\nQ: Is it okay to work on a project we've created in the past?\nA: Yes, feel free to use an existing project as a starting point, and create something new out of it. You can also come armed with pieces of code you might have worked on in the past and use it to get your project off the ground faster. Be sure to show one of our engineers the work you’ve already completed in the beginning, as we’ll judge your product based on the progress you make during the event.",
